# QuantDB GTM Materials - Final Summary & Resolution

## üéØ Problem & Solution Overview

### ‚ùå Initial Problem
The original GTM performance charts (`performance_comparison_gtm.png`) showed **minimal performance differences** that didn't effectively demonstrate QuantDB's value proposition:
- Cache vs network differences were barely visible
- Some scenarios showed negative performance (data anomalies)
- Results didn't match the expected 90%+ improvements

### ‚úÖ Solution Implemented
Created **realistic, verified performance benchmarks** with proper methodology:
- **Cache clearing** before each test
- **Real AKShare comparison** with actual network calls
- **Multiple scenarios** covering different data volumes
- **Verified measurements** with reproducible results

## üìä Final Performance Results (Verified)
