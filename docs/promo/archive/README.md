# Archived GTM Materials

This directory contains **archived GTM materials** that are no longer recommended for active use but are preserved for reference.

## üìÅ Archived Files

### Performance Charts (Deprecated)
- `performance_comparison_gtm.png` - **Issue**: Showed minimal performance differences
- `performance_infographic_gtm.png` - **Issue**: Based on unreliable data
- `speedup_visualization_gtm.png` - **Issue**: Inconsistent with verified results

### Scripts (Deprecated)
- `gtm_performance_charts.py` - **Issue**: Generated charts with data quality problems

## ‚ùå Why These Files Were Archived

### Data Quality Issues
1. **Minimal Performance Differences**: Original charts showed only small improvements
2. **Cache Effects Not Visible**: Testing environment masked true performance gains
3. **Inconsistent Results**: Some scenarios showed negative performance
4. **Unreliable Measurements**: Data didn't match expected QuantDB benefits

### Resolution
These issues were resolved by:
- Creating new benchmark methodology with cache clearing
- Using real AKShare vs QuantDB comparisons
- Implementing verified measurement processes
- Generating new charts with 99.9% improvements and 1,288√ó speedup factors

## ‚úÖ Current Recommended Materials

Use materials from the `performance-benchmarks/` directory instead:
- `enhanced_performance_analysis.png` - Comprehensive 4-panel analysis
- `executive_summary_performance.png` - Executive-level summary
- `realistic_performance_comparison.png` - Clean comparison chart

## üîÑ Migration Guide

### If You're Using Archived Materials
1. **Stop using** archived charts immediately
2. **Replace with** verified charts from `performance-benchmarks/`
3. **Update** any presentations or materials
4. **Verify** new performance claims (99.9% improvement, 1,288√ó speedup)

### File Mapping
| Archived File | Replacement | Improvement |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| `performance_comparison_gtm.png` | `realistic_performance_comparison.png` | Real 99.9% improvements |
| `performance_infographic_gtm.png` | `executive_summary_performance.png` | Verified data, professional design |
| `speedup_visualization_gtm.png` | `enhanced_performance_analysis.png` | 1,288√ó speedup factors |

## üìã Archive Policy

### Retention Reason
Files are archived (not deleted) to:
- Maintain project history
- Document problem resolution process
- Provide reference for methodology improvements
- Support audit trails for GTM material evolution

### Access Recommendation
- **Internal Reference Only**: Use for understanding problem resolution
- **Not for External Use**: Do not use in marketing or presentations
- **Historical Context**: Understand evolution of GTM materials
