# AI Agent Documentation

This directory contains documentation and schemas specifically designed for AI agents and automated tools that interact with the QuantDB package.

## Files

### `ai-agent-documentation-guide.md`
Comprehensive guide for AI agents on how to understand and use QuantDB effectively, including:
- Docstring standards
- Function signatures
- Best practices for code generation
- Error handling patterns

### `qdb-ai-agent-schema.json`
Structured JSON schema defining all QuantDB functions, parameters, and return types in a format optimized for AI agent consumption:
- Function definitions with type information
- Parameter validation rules
- Example usage patterns
- Error codes and handling

## Purpose

These files are designed to help AI coding assistants, documentation generators, and other automated tools better understand and work with the QuantDB API. They are not part of the main user documentation but serve as reference materials for AI systems.

## Usage

AI agents can reference these files to:
1. Generate accurate code examples
2. Validate function calls and parameters
3. Provide better error handling
4. Understand the package structure and conventions

## Maintenance

These files should be updated whenever:
- New functions are added to the QuantDB API
- Function signatures change
- Documentation standards evolve
- AI agent feedback indicates improvements needed
