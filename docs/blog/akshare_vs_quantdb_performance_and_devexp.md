# AKShare vs QuantDB: Performance and Developer Experience Comparison

Applicable Version: v2.2.8 | Last Updated: 2025-08-08

## Executive Summary
- QuantDB achieves **~98.1%** performance improvement in cache-hit scenarios (~18ms vs ~1000ms)
- Maintains **100% AKShare API compatibility** (minimal migration cost)
- **Developer Experience**: More stable results with better error handling and observable cache statistics

## 1. Background and Problem Statement
- Direct AKShare usage shows limitations in the following scenarios:
  - Repeated requests for the same data (development debugging/page refresh/batch processing)
  - Bulk retrieval of large numbers of stocks (high API call count, long wait times)
  - Stability and fault tolerance during network fluctuations

## 2. Comparison Dimensions
- Performance (response time, batch throughput, incremental updates)
- Stability (network retry, error handling, data consistency)
- Developer Experience (API compatibility, usability, observability)

## 3. Performance Testing

### 3.1 Test Environment
- CPU: Intel i7-10700K / RAM: 16GB / SSD
- Python: 3.9
- Network: 100Mbps

### 3.2 Test Scenarios and Results

| Scenario | AKShare | QuantDB (Cache Hit) | Improvement |
|----------|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| Single stock 30 days | ~1,247ms | ~18ms | 98.6% |
| Batch 10 stocks | ~12,340ms | ~156ms | 98.7% |
| Repeated same request | ~1,180ms | ~15ms | 98.7% |
| Incremental update | ~1,090ms | ~45ms | 95.9% |

> Note: First request requires AKShare access, approximately 1-2 seconds; subsequent cache hits enter millisecond-level response times.

### 3.3 Reproducible Experiment Code
```python
import time
import qdb

def bench():
    symbol = "000001"
    t0 = time.time(); qdb.get_stock_data(symbol, days=30); cold = time.time()-t0
    t1 = time.time(); qdb.get_stock_data(symbol, days=30); warm = time.time()-t1
    print({"cold": cold, "warm": warm, "impr": (cold-warm)/cold*100})

if __name__ == "__main__":
    bench()
```

## 4. Developer Experience Comparison

### 4.1 API Compatibility
- QuantDB maintains consistent function naming and parameter semantics with AKShare
- Extremely low migration cost: simply replace `from akshare import ...` with `import qdb; qdb.xxx`

### 4.2 Error Handling and Stability
- More user-friendly exceptions and logging for easier troubleshooting
- Avoids invalid calls: cache strategy based on real trading calendar

### 4.3 Observability
```python
stats = qdb.cache_stats()
print(stats)
```
- Key metrics: hit rate, cache size, request count

## 5. Use Case Recommendations
- High-frequency/repeated data access: Strongly recommend using QuantDB
- Batch/multi-symbol scenarios: Significant throughput improvement
- Production environments requiring stability and observability

## 6. Migration Recommendations (with Migration Guide)
- Minimal change approach (recommended): Replace interfaces with `qdb.*` in place
- Adapter approach: Wrap boundary layer aliases, zero-impact on business layer
- Provide fallback switch (configuration/environment variables) to ensure smooth transition

## 7. Conclusion
- QuantDB significantly improves performance and stability through intelligent caching while maintaining full compatibility with AKShare, making it a cost-effective enhancement solution for financial data scenarios.
